Here is the Backend for my university project in web engineering. It focuses on logging and viewing the drinking habits of other patients. 
Administrators have the ability to add, delete, or edit patients in the system, while nurses can edit patient data.
In the backend, passwords are hashed, cookies are created and processed, and login data is authenticated. MongoDB is used as the database in this project.

Here I mainly use TypeScript.
